Hi Creech,

I got your email from Real Girl and Dirt Girl!  I'd be happy to help =
with UnCruz decompression.  I know you're leaving for the playa soon, so =
just get back to me when you get back.  As of now I'm signed up to do a =
greeter shift for Real Girl, but if you want me to be in charge of =
something larger, I'd be happy to.  I'm very organized and responsible!

Have a great burn,
CatNip

HOO - What a Ride!"
