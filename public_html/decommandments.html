<p>We are gifting 2 free drink tickets to the first 700 attendees over 21 at UnSCruz! There will be no alcohol sales. Here's why</p>

<p>In planning UnSCruz as an official Burning Man Regional Event, we have to shape the event on the basis of the Ten Principles (Link to http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html#.Uz7bnhZA_jc), one of which is Decommodification. This means in order to keep the event free from money, much like Burning Man, no money can be exchanged at overnight campout events and everyone should bring everything they need — food, water, costumes, tomfoolery, etc. To stay in line with this principle, there will be no food or alcohol sales at UnSCruz</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, for liability reasons, the Fairgrounds does not allow outside alcohol. If there's going to be booze, it has to be served by their licensed folks.</p>

    <div id="volunteer_dialog" class="dlg-one-em" title="UnSCruz Volunteers">
      <p>One significant and incredible aspect of Burning Man culture is volunteerism.  Volunteering your time is a tremendous gift, and it is also a great way to get involved, in what is essentially <strong>your</strong> event.  UnSCruz cannot exist without volunteers. This is a not-for-profit event, no one gets paid a dime, and many people contribute 100s of hours to make it happen.  The funds we collect in ticket sales go right back into making UnSCruz happen again, at an affordable price.  Thank you so much, your help is very much appreciated!!</p>
