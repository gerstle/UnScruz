Hi Blysse,

Thanks for taking on this task.

The layout I crafted was primarily for the purpose of getting a permit. 
I took into consideration what was on the Church St (the old location), 
such that the music was facing into what will be an empty parking lot. 
However, I doubt that it is identical on Locust St, so you should move 
things around as you wish. I made up the "mountain" and "beach" theme to 
represent Santa Cruz, but you should name them whatever you wish.

My understanding of the "fire lane" is that you can put people there, 
but you can't place structure there. I think the idea is that people 
will move, but canopies won't without assistance. Putting the fire lane 
down the middle might work if no theme camps need more than what is 
remaining, approx 10-14' (?). That's why I put the fire lane down one 
side to give camps more room. However, I had in mind to move it to the 
middle if no theme camp application asked for more area, and there were 
sufficient number of camps to warrant it.

Cheers,

Hey sista,<br>
    <br>
Fun to see you this past weekend! Thanks for joining us!<br>
    <br>
Here is the layout of the UnScruz event from Big Mike. Difference
between<br>
now and then (when he first created this) is that now we are on a
different<br>
street, we are not on Locust street. You can get a pic of it online via<br>
GoogleEarth or something I'd assume?<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I placed the theme camps to show where static objects
would be. I think<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; we should change this, of course, when we have an idea
what will go<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; into<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; those spaces.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I updated the map to say 14' and attached it here.<br>

seems like<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she's taking a more "tell" then "ask" approach with

inform the new<br>

but nothing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else.  mike, I saw your design and it looks like
you've got 2 "areas"<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for theme camps, Mountain and Beach.    I assume that
we'll fill both<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of those with multiple things such as static art,
theme camps, etc?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, can you update the map you just sent out to
state 14 feet<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of 12?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fire permits:  Got contact information for fire
permits.    Each<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing that lights up must be approved individually, so
we'll have to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work with artists, camps and performers to get that
