      <div class='question'>
      What should I bring?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      Food, water, costumes, camping gear, silly costumes, things to gift and share with your neighbors, and garbage bags to pack out your trash.

      Will there be food sold at the event?
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Will there be alcohol sold at the event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      We will be giving 2 free drink tickets to the first 700 people who show up to UnSCruz. There will be no alcohol sales and no outside alcohol is allowed. Confused? That’s okay, read the full story <a href="http://unscruz.com/decommandments.html">here</a>.</br><br/>
The bar will be open at 5pm on Saturday and will close when the beer runs out.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Can I camp next to my car? Can I come back to the parking lot and my car to change and get stuff once I get into the event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      No. Camping will be inside the fairgrounds, cars will be in the parking lot. <span "class=red">there are no ins and outs</span>. Bring everything you need with you for the event.</br></br>If you leave the event on Saturday, you will be able to come back to the event at 6am on Sunday as long as you are still wearing your wristband. If you leave the event on Sunday, you won’t be able to come back in.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      So I have a ton of stuff I need to get into UnSCruz and I need to make multiple trips. How’s that going to work if there’s no ins and outs?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      We will have a couple shuttles that will take your gear from the parking lot and bring it into the event. You’ll have to have your wristband before we can drop off your gear!

      <div class='question'>
      What is the policy with Recreational Vehicles (RVs)?

      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      When’s the music going?
      </div>

      Is this a kid-friendly event?
