Yes, I have the recordings. I don't think we got 100%, but we got about 9 hours worth.

I've been working on the recordings, setting their levels and compression, etc. I got 'em just before BMan, so I haven't finished gettin' to

I can place what we have online. I'd love to identify which DJs are playing.
