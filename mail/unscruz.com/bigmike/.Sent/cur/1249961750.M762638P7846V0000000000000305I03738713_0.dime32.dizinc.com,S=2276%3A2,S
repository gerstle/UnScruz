Hi Greg,

I joined the project with an enthusiasm to build a musical project that 
included a stage and some big sound. That isn't really practical now, 
and so I've lost a bit of my drive to work on this. Not a reflection on 
anybody, just the situation I'm facing. I have no ill feelings, although 
I suspect my withdrawal may generate some.

I'd be happy to host and provide tech support for the website. I'm still 
hoping to be part of the local community building in our area.

Cheers,
