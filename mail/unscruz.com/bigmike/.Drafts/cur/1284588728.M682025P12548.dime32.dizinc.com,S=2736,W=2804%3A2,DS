    I'm so pleased they chose your sound camp. You're one of three, and

              My name is Mike and I am with Unknown Prophecies. I am
              looking to put together a sound stage for this years
              Uncruz BM Decomp. I am currently working with Jake from
              Vibrant Eyeris and Your Music Magazine and we are looking
              to put together a mix of live music that consists of live
              electronic sounds, to conscious hip hop and spoken word.
              Some of the artists we are looking to bring out are of
              course Vibrant Eyeris, Lyrical I, Audiofauna, Trip
              Delight, Clay w/Constant Creation and some other amazing
              sounds.<br>
              Our mix of culture will definately fit in well with the
              burning man feel and hope we will be able to show the
              Santa Cruz Burners a little flavor of the Unknown
              Prophets. <br>
              <br>
              If you have any questions about our stage or need to get
              in touch, please contact me at 831-227-9886<br>
              <br>
              Cheers and have a beautiful day<br>
