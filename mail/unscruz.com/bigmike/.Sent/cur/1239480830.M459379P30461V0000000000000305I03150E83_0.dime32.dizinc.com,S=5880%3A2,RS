Hi John,

I've created a preliminary layout of the UnScruz space. See 
http://unscruz.com/UnScruzLayout2009.pdf

It's a PDF in Illustrator format. Let me know if you need a different 
format to edit this. The measurements were taken by pacing, so they are 
only approximate.

Of note are that I'm trying to block access to the adjacent property 
using the porto-potties. Also, I've routed the safety lane through the 
"dance" areas. Finally, the names of the villages are bogus; I made 'em 
up to stimulate discussion.

I put the DJ in that area in the hopes that the building might block 
some of the stage sound to the DJ. This still needs a real life 
verification, and the DJ could be moved elsewhere.

Cheers
