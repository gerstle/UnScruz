It seems to be working, Tracy. I just logged in, and the site was 
updated on Oct 9.

To access the website's CPanel, try https://unscruz.bm/cpanel/ using the 
same credentials.

If you continue to have problems, please send me a log of the failure. I 
can help :-)

Cheers,

Also, if you can get the .ai files for the art that would be helpful!

Still interested in helping with the UnSCruz web site? We need
something
up
ASAP, literally.

I have attached the main and the web graphic. You can work with it
to
make
it work for the site. As you will see, the web graphic needs to
have
the
date changed or removed from the top.

Also, will you please use the graphic in some way that you can add
the
date,
time and place and other details so that I may also use it at a
flyer
(8.5
x
11) and it's legible? I will want two of these -- one with just the
date,
time and place and one with as much as you can fit on there.

As for the web site, I believe we need the following:
1) home page with main details
2) volunteer page (I'll be getting you a list of jobs we need done,
etc.
This will need to be updated periodically -- probably every couple
of
days
or so
3) contact us page
Think we need anything else?

Any chance you might want to do a pro bono job for the Santa Cruz
Burning
Man region and design a simple web site for UnScruz.

We already have the poster/artwork so it would be based on that
design.
All
we need are like three or four pages -- home, about, contact, and
possibly
one other page.

I'd take your design and give it to a developer who has offered to
do
the
development pro bono as well. YAY!

Let me know!

Thanks,
Tracy
