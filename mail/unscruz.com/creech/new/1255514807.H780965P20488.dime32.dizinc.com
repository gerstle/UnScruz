Hey Creech,I'm a young burner from Davis, I'll be in Santa Cruz this weekend
for the street party, and I'd love to light my new fire staff. I'd like to
be on the roster for a fire performance, as I couldn't get on the SF
Decomp's because they filled so fast. Are there any spots left for this
Saturday, and are permits required for open flame in SC (could I light up if
not on a stage?)?
Thanks,
