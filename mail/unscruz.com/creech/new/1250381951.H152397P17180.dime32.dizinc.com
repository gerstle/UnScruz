I won't get to go this year after 6 years, so I am thrilled you sent  
this - it is on my calendar immediately.

I only do video (for a living) - I could bring a camera.

I am sending this to a BM friend you may know who plays at the  
Seabreeze bar and grill in Aptos to see if he is interested - recently  
did a music video for him.

I also have always wanted to do something for Burners Without Borders,  
but since I have been hugely busy, I haven't yet got anything together,
but if you are interested, I could set up a table for donations for  
them - I was in contact with the person in charge but did not followup  
this year to get video from them
to hold an event but I could try again.   (My little part to give back)

I will also pass this on to my two sisters and brother in San Fran.   
One of them (Shebatt) was in charge of the Man Krew who built the man  
6 and 5 years ago.

Thanks much, have fun at BM!

Denise
