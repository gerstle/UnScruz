Please do, Greg. You are operating under my authority, and I have 
enlisted your help. So you have every right to say how you would like to 
see this go, who's a possible performer, etc. I encourage your direct 
participation, and will likely invite you to a meeting later on where we 
work out logistics with others.

FYI, the following people have roles in this event. The first three are 
principals that are putting up the money to make it happen (including me):
*Creech-Producer, BM Regional Coordinator, Permits, Facilities, Security
*Brian-Coordinator with property owners, government agencies, and event 
manager, theme camp coordinator
*Big Mike-Musical Talent & Stage Performers, Event Layout, Website
Gerg-Talent Coordinator (that's, uh, you)
Luke-DJ Coordinator
Jennie-Graphics
Catherine-Website Design
Joy-Bookkeeping
Kelsea-Tickets and Front Gate

We'll be recruiting for more managers shortly, as there's still many 
areas left to address.

Thanks so much for your help.

  <br>
We have an official date set for our UnScruz Burning Man Street Faire. <br>
It's October 17, 2009 in the Sentinel parking lot in Santa Cruz. I am
so <br>
stoked! That is a great day in my opinion for weather and other reasons.<br>
  <br>
That is also the 20th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, so we <br>
must be sensitive to the victims and survivors of that disaster, but we
  <br>
can use it if we do it properly. I will propose a moment of silence at <br>
17:04. Perhaps we can do something else, too.<br>
  <br>
So, let's get started on our plans.<br>
  <br>
Jennie and Catherine, I've assumed the manager's role in creating and <br>
managing the website, so I'll be contacting you both to get this
rolling.<br>
Kurian and Greg, please confirm with me that you are still willing and <br>
able to work with me on the stage performances. This is so gonna rock.<br>
  <br>
Cheers,<br>
