<p>We are gifting 2 free drink tickets to the first 700 attendees over 21 at UnSCruz! There will be no alcohol sales. Here's why:</p>

<p>In planning UnSCruz as an official Burning Man Regional Event, we have to shape the event on the basis of the <a href="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html">Ten Principles</a>, one of which is Decommodification. This means in order to keep the event free from money, much like Burning Man, no money can be exchanged at overnight campout events and everyone should bring everything they need - food, water, costumes, tomfoolery, etc. To stay in line with this principle, there will be no food or alcohol sales at UnSCruz.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, for liability reasons, the Fairgrounds does not allow outside alcohol. If there's going to be booze, it has to be served by their licensed folks.</p>

          <p>To keep the principle of Decommodification, and to keep some beer flowing, we have set aside some money to <span class="red"><strong>GIFT two free drink tickets to the first 700 folks over 21 who buy a ticket to UnSCruz</strong></span>. We hope this will allow people to imbibe responsibly, AND if you don't feel like drinking, you can GIFT your ticket to someone else! See? GIFTING! Another Burning Man principle!</p>

<p>Right now we're budgeted for the first 700 people, but as the numbers shape up, we can adjust this amount to make sure most folks can get themselves a drink at the bar.</p>

<p>Burning Man events always challenge their participants to search for creative solutions to problems, and we feel this creative solution balances both worlds pretty well. If this policy causes you some problems, think of some creative ways that work for you and your camping crew - UnSCruz is a feast for the eyes, ears, and soul that you do NOT want to miss!</p>
