Hi Kurian,

Heaping mounds of gratitude and excitement can be found. Thanks!

I am coordinating talent with the help of my brother, Greg. I am very 
open to your suggestions, and welcome them happily.

The official name will be discussed when we next meet. We were planning 
for a June party before, and Street Fair seemed right. I agree with you 
that Decompression is probably more recognizable to burners, even though 
I personally don't care for the name.

Who's coordinating talent?  Can I offer some help/suggestions now that
the date is a bit further away?  (I don't mean just music, but art,
decor, performance, etc...)<br>
  <br>
Incidentally, is there some edict about not using the term "decom"? 
I'm wondering why the choice to use the term "street faire".  Seems
like designating it as the SC decom might help bring more attention...<br>

sounds great! catherine has my graphics for the website, all i need is
your FINAL text for the poster - as this poster will have
text-turned-to-outline and it will be a big pain in the cracker to
adjust later, but it will look bitchin' and i can do a tshirt graphic
too so we can get some tees made or just do the cafe press show, let me
know if you are interested - someone just pointed out to me that the
colors on the poster are the same from endless summer and what an
awesome tie in that was with the lighthouse, i think (personally, in my
humble and nonsensed opinion) that it is strong and we can really grab
people's attention with this! <br>
  <br>
thanks also for letting me know the date, im trying to plan the decom
for mpyre and want to make sure we dont coincide! <br>
  <br>
this is GREAT and thanks for all your hard work on this, i know how
difficult it can be! jb<br>

It's October 17, 2009 in the Sentinel parking lot in Santa Cruz. I am

That is also the 20th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, so we

Kurian and Greg, please confirm with me that you are still willing and
