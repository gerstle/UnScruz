It looks great. Please note that the correct spelling is "Sentinel".

I can create an mail address for burningbeach. Would you like the mail forwarded, or stored on the server?

I also think we could create an announcement list for people to join just to receive announcements, such as announce@unscruz.com

I've made a first-pass at the layout of the grounds and forwarded this to John. Check it out at http://unscruz.com/UnScruzLayout2009.pdf



Cheers,
