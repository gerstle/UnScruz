      <pre wrap="">Hey creech.. This is Jason Lara... Just wanted to touch base with u and discuss some supperrrr goodies and additions I'd like to contribute to unscrew this year: 

Fire spinning
Shadow box dancing high def visuals 
Possible laser show array. 
And promotions for unscruZ. 

I am planning on integrating my setup with phil from the dancetronauts who will be providing all power for my setup. 

I cant wait for u to see the new T60's we have built. Longest sub horns on the planet right now. Should be a greatttt addition to unscruz this year. Everyones talkin about them. Can't wait to see them in action on the 2nd.
