We have an official date set for our UnScruz Burning Man Street Faire. 
It's October 17, 2009 in the Sentinel parking lot in Santa Cruz. I am so 
stoked! That is a great day in my opinion for weather and other reasons.

That is also the 20th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, so we 
must be sensitive to the victims and survivors of that disaster, but we 
can use it if we do it properly. I will propose a moment of silence at 
17:04. Perhaps we can do something else, too.

So, let's get started on our plans.

Jennie and Catherine, I've assumed the manager's role in creating and 
managing the website, so I'll be contacting you both to get this rolling.
Kurian and Greg, please confirm with me that you are still willing and 
able to work with me on the stage performances. This is so gonna rock.

Cheers,
