      We’ll have Sunday tickets available at the gate for $15. There won’t be any Saturday only passes.

      <div class='question'>
      What should I expect when I get there?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      <p>Awesome, awesome people. Beautiful art. Thumping music. A nice green lawn. Friendly neighbors. Bring your camping gear, and make a space that’s fun, inviting, and creative!</p>

<p>Burning Man events are all about <strong>participation</strong>. So bring your energy, whimsy, enthusiasm! And familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html">Ten Principles of Burning Man</a> and read these Decommandments:
<ol>
<li>Read ALL these FAQs!</li>
<li>There are NO INS AND OUTS between the event and the parking lot. Prepare for this and bring everything you need into the event! </li>
<li>Respect your neighbors, respect the staff, respect the Fairgrounds.</li>
<li>LEAVE NO TRACE! You are part of the Leave No Trace team. Pack out whatever you brought in. Please pick up any trash, paper, feathery bits.</li>
<li>Perform random acts of art, kindness, and giving.</li>
<li>NO renegade sound, outside alcohol, illegal drugs, firearms, fireworks, or unapproved fire performance or fire art.</li>
<li>Volunteer! This is a volunteer-driven event! Stop by Playa Info or the Volunteer Check-In.</li>
<li>Sorry, no nudity at this event. Bikini tops and bootie shorts welcomed.</li>
<li>This is a PACK IT IN, PACK IT OUT Event! Bring enough of your own food and water (no outside alcohol!) to survive for two days in a not-so-harsh coastal environment.</li>
</ol>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      What should I bring?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      <p>Food, water, costumes, camping gear, silly costumes, things to gift and share with your neighbors, and garbage bags to pack out your trash.</p><p>No renegade sound, outside alcohol, illegal drugs, weapons, fireworks, unapproved fire performance or fire art.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Will there be food sold at the event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      No, everyone needs to bring their own food and water to the event. Radical self reliance people!
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Will there be alcohol sold at the event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      We will be giving 2 free drink tickets to the first 700 people who show up to UnSCruz. There will be no alcohol sales and no outside alcohol is allowed. Confused? That’s okay, read the full story <a href="http://unscruz.com/decommandments.html">here</a>.</br><br/>
The bar will be open at 5pm on Saturday and will close when the beer runs out.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Can I camp next to my car or trailer? Can I come back to the parking lot and my car to change and get stuff once I get into the event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
<p>No, the parking lot and the event are separate. THERE ARE NO INS &amp; OUTS. You must bring everything you need for your time at UnSCruz — camping gear, coolers, chairs, food, change of clothes, etc. </p>

<p>If you leave the event on Saturday, you will be able to come back to the event after 6am on Sunday as long as you are still wearing your wristband. If you leave the event on Sunday, you won’t be able to come back in.</p>

<p>Yes, we know this is a bit inconvenient, but it's Fairgrounds policy. Plan ahead!</p>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      So I have a ton of stuff I need to get into UnSCruz and I need to make multiple trips. How’s that going to work if there’s no ins and outs?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      <p>We will have a couple shuttles that will take your gear from the parking lot and bring it into the event. You’ll have to have your wristband before we can drop off your gear!</p>
      <p>Shuttles will be carrying attendees camping supplies from the parking lot to the main grass area, running from the time the gate opens at 3 pm to sunset Saturday, then in reverse from 5 pm to 7 pm Sunday.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      But I have an RV/Trailer I want to sleep in!
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      <p>There are a limited number of RV spots inside the event for $75 (this includes one general admission ticket) that are first come first serve and can be bought at unscruz2014.brownpapertickets.com. This allows you unfettered access to your RV during the entire event. Each spot will have hookups whether or not you need them.</p>

<p>If you don't get one of these RV tickets, your vehicle will be out in the parking lot and the no Ins &amp; Outs policy will apply, so you will need to bring what you need to the event each day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      When’s the music going?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      We’re going to have a lot of music! We’ll have two inside sound rooms and sound will go on until 11pm. We’ll also have outside dance and music performances going on until 7pm. These are the Fairgrounds sound ordinances. We’ll start the music back up on Sunday at 11am.</br></br>

We’re working on a Silent Disco for afterhours though, we need some volunteers to help make this a reality! <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1mx5bSx">Click here</a> to volunteer!</strong>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Are pets allowed?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      No. Please leave the critters at home!
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Is this a kid-friendly event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      Yes! Just like Burning Man, there will be a lot of radical self expression and we would love to have your kids come see the spectacle!</br></br>
Kids under 12 are free. Anyone 18 and under MUST be accompanied by a legal guardian.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Are barbeques allowed?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>

      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Are there toilets?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>

      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      What kind of facilities do you provide for those in a wheelchair?

      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      Can we have campfires? Can I bring my fire poi?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      Nope. No renegade fire, this includes fire performances and campfires. All fire must be registered before the event with Celicius Maximus. Email us at <a href="mailto:info@unscruz.com" target="_top">info@unscruz.com</a> if you’re interested in bringing some fire.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      What about trash?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      Like all Burning Man events, we strongly encourage you to be self-reliant, pack it in, and pack it out.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
      What time does the event end?

      Can I photograph the event?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
      Yes, feel free to take pictures and video, but there are a couple guidelines.
      <ol>
<li><strong>ASK FOR CONSENT</strong>. Make sure the people you are filming want to be filmed.</li>
<li>You may not use your photographs or videography for commercial gain.</li>
</ol>

    <div id="volunteer_dialog" class="dlg-one-em" title="UnSCruz Volunteers">
      <p>One significant and incredible aspect of Burning Man culture is volunteerism.  Volunteering your time is a tremendous gift, and it is also a great way to get involved, in what is essentially <strong>your</strong> event.  UnSCruz cannot exist without volunteers. This is a not-for-profit event, no one gets paid a dime, and many people contribute 100s of hours to make it happen.  The funds we collect in ticket sales go right back into making UnSCruz happen again, at an affordable price.  Thank you so much, your help is very much appreciated!!</p>
      <p>
