Hi Catherine,

We are starting over. For example, we haven't yet decided to call this a
Decom, although it probably makes sense to do so.

We'll be meeting soon, I'm sure, and have specifics to offer you. If you
are thinking about the layout, we'll probably need some space for the
following items on the front page:
- Music headliners
- DJ headliners
- A description of the event as a participant-funded activity
- Particulars, date, time, location
(currently Sentinel Parking Lot, Cedar and Church St, Oct 17, noon to 10
pm, tix $15, playa-wear $10)
- Links to burning man, especially the 10 principles
- Links to discussion fora (which we can create)
- Links to full activity schedules, artist, music, and DJ lineups
- Links to tickets
- Links to applications for theme camps, performers, and fire performers
- and a bunch of other stuff I haven't thought of, yet.

Thanks so much for working on this, <smile>

It's October 17, 2009 in the Sentinel parking lot in Santa Cruz. I am

          <br>
That is also the 20th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, so we

Jennie and Catherine, I've assumed the manager's role in creating and

Kurian and Greg, please confirm with me that you are still willing and
