Hi JK,

Thanks for your help on this. We'll be meeting soon to determine the
exact name of the event, and other specifics to offer you. Hopefully,
I'll have this in the next couple of weeks. Is that soon enough?

I think the Lighthouse makes an awesome icon. I think we can do better
with silk-screened T's than Cafe Press, but I'll let others decide that.
I mean, who wears T's when they're naked? LOL

Hugs,

It's October 17, 2009 in the Sentinel parking lot in Santa Cruz. I am

That is also the 20th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, so we

Jennie and Catherine, I've assumed the manager's role in creating and

Kurian and Greg, please confirm with me that you are still willing and
