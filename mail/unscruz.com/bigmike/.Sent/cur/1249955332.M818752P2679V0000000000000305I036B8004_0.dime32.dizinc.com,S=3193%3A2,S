I've been giving this some thought, and I've decided to withdraw from 
the street fair project for a while. At least from the weekly/periodic 
meetings and initial planning. I may choose later to participate in the 
street fair, but I haven't really given that much thought.

I wish you all great success in herding our local kittens into the pride 
of Santa Cruz. I know it won't be easy, but I'm sure you will get 'er done.

Regards,
